- 👋 Hi there, I’m Barbi.
- 👀 I’m interested in labour relationships and specially how my job impact others' lives.
- 🌱 I love reading and am a huge Kindle lover. Yeah, there's nothing like the smell of a book - but Kindle's lightness is fantastic!
- 💞️ My thing is to collaborate on connecting IT professionals with job opportunities that expand their possibilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: barbara.macherett@southgeeks.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbaramacherett/
